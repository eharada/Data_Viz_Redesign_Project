# Data_Viz_Redesign_Project

## Project Statement:

For this project I wanted to focus on the healthcare industry and more specifically healthcare and technology. Although mental health has been around for decades, is a newly dicussed topic especially in Silicon Valley. The data set was pulled from Kaggle.com, which pulls in survey data for how comfortable people feel with being open with their mental health in the technoogy workplace.

The data visualization that Kaggle user, Lislejoem, created focuses more on bar charts that show the difference between yes/no questions. He divides the groups by those who have reached out for support and those who have not.

I would like to take the same data and add geography in the equation. My goal is to see if there is more openness to mental health in certain states and if that is related to how much people perceive it to interfere with their work.
