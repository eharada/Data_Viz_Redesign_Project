# Data_Viz_Redesign_Project

## Project Statement:

For this project I wanted to focus on the healthcare industry and more specifically healthcare and technology. Although mental health has been around for decades, is a newly dicussed topic especially in Silicon Valley. The data set was pulled from Kaggle.com, which pulls in survey data for how comfortable people feel with being open with their mental health in the technoogy workplace.

The data visualization that Kaggle user, Lislejoem, created focuses more on bar charts that show the difference between yes/no questions. He focuses more on the difference in opinion between those who have reached out for support and those who have not.

I would like to take the same data and add geography in the equation. My goal is to see if there is more openness to mental health in certain states and if that is related to how much people perceive it to interfere with their work.

## Project Progression:
<b>1st: </b>
First I started with my exploratory visual with the current data that I had. I wanted to get a clear picture of what was possible and if there was any correlation that I was missing from just looking at the spreadsheet. With that, I created these visuals that show which states have the highest number of tech employees who feel that their mental health interferes with their work as well as the number of companies who don't offer or don't make it clear that they have wellness programs.

The above graphs depict California as being the top state in which tech employees believe their mental health interferes with their work. It is also the top state in which employees aren't sure if their employers offers wellness programs.
